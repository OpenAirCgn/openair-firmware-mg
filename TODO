- scour LIBS for unecessary includes:
   - restrict CA's to those actually used, potentially add "own"

- move some functionality into libs, or reuse functions from libs:
	- bme sensor (lib exists)
	- quadsense / noisemeter -> possibly externalize
	- ADC create lib

- provide DNS for AP, e.g. be able to connect to openair.local

- lora & rfm85/sx1276:
	- radiohead
	- lmic
	- semtech ref
	- own
